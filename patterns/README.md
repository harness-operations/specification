# Operational Patterns

**Status:** Draft for Applied Harness Operations v0.3

These patterns turn the Harness Operations reference model into practical operational guidance.

They are not protocol requirements, conformance rules, or universal implementation recipes. Each pattern describes a problem, the assumptions under which a control is meaningful, relevant native mechanisms, expected failure behavior, useful evidence, and known limitations.

Initial patterns:

1. [Approval valid at execution time](approval-valid-at-execution-time.md)
2. [Stop, revoke, and recover](stop-revoke-and-recover.md)
3. [Model-informed decisions, code-enforced consequences](model-informed-decisions.md)

The patterns are grounded in:

- the deterministic [approved-artifact handoff example](../examples/approved-artifact-handoff/README.md);
- the versioned [Codex App Server 0.157.0 mapping](../mappings/codex-app-server-0.157.0.md);
- the versioned [Claude Code CLI 2.1.282 mapping](../mappings/claude-code-cli-2.1.282.md).

Implementation-specific mechanisms remain native to those systems. The patterns describe the operational properties to preserve, not a common wire format.
